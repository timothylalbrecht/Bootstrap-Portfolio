# Bootstrap-Portfolio
Overall, I found this assignment gave me a few more headaches than the previous one, which is probably to be expected. 

Im a little bummed that life got in the way a little for the initial due date of this assignment. Im pleased with what im submitting, but I was hoping to add a few more details, which I still plan to do later.
