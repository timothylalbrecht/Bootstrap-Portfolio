/*----------------COMMENTS AND REMARKS------------------
I wasnt really feeling bootstrap when I started this assignment. I could appreciate it for what it is, but the idea of playing around and finding the exact make up of class names vs just adding a little custom css seemed silly...
That changed when i moved on to the portfolio page. The grid system is intuitive, and knowing the built in rules meant I didnt have to go track down the small issues that seemed to pop out of no where using plan 'ol css. 

I was not able to find a simple, concise way of altering the default colors, so i just used some custom css for our teal color. I tried to limit everything in this file. A few times I wanted margins and the like larger than the 6th level, so added those, as well as most of the contact form unfortunately. Life got in the way this weekend with a plumbing issue, plus some tree removal before hurricane Flo, so I plan on going back and updating the contact form to use the bootstrap class buttons and a few other features.
