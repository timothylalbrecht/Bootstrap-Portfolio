                <p>Hello! My name is Tim Albrecht, and welcome to my first site! I am currently enrolled in the UNC coding Bootcamp, and have successfully made it through the front-end! So hereâ€™s a little bit about me. Take in what you like, and let me know of any constructive criticism you may have for the page.</p>
                <p>I have been a resident of Chapel Hill for the last 12 years. I started as an undergraduate at UNC, where I received a BS in Environmental Sciences. I then moved on to be a staff environmental scientist with RTI International for the next four years. My work focused on federal contracts with the EPA, FDA, DoE, and NOAA. A new opportunity arose, and I chose to leave RTI to start my own Fiber Optic Company, which I actively operated for the past three years. However, I came to miss my previous passions, as well as the limited home time, so opted to return to the environmental sector.</p>
                <p>I am lucky enough to have married my high school sweetheart, Sarah. She was there with me to take my first steps on campus, and has somehow already put up with me for over 12 years. Together we live with our two dogs, Roxy and Pepper, in rural Chapel Hill.</p>
                <p>As I continue to work this coding program, I hope to begin applying my gained knowledge toward environmentally-themed applications. With passions in energy and city sustainability, I hope to find a unique opportunity to bridge my past and present.</p>
